# Welcome to Harrison's GitHub Profile! :)

## About Me
I am a rising senior at Bucknell Universityâ€™s College of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and minoring in Mathematics and Economics. Some relevant courses that I have taken (or will be taking in my final year) are:

- Computer Science : Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering and Design, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Operating Systems Design, Intro to Data Mining, Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, Computer Architecture and Organization, Digital System Design

- Mathematics : Calculus 1 and 2, Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis

- Economics : Econometrics, Financial Economics, Risk Management in Financial Markets

## Interests
- **Economics and Finance**: Exploring quantitative analysis, financial modeling, and investment banking.
- **Applied Math**: Enthusiastic about using mathematical principles to solve real-world problems.
- **Software Engineering**: Passionate about designing and developing software solutions for corporate clients and consumers alike.
- **Quantum Mechanics and Computing**: Fascinated by the potential of quantum technologies and their applications in an everevolving field that is just waiting to be brought to the mainstream.
- **Hardware Engineering**: Interested in the synergy and integration of software and hardware systems.

## Projects and Work Experience
- **Projects**:
  - **[Diabetes Data Project](https://github.com/harrison-hal3sworth/harrison-hal3sworth/tree/main/data_mining_final_proj)**: For this project I went through the entire data mining pipeline to analyze patient data related to Diabetes diagnoses. I used the numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, tensorflow libraries as well as a few others to prepare and clean the data from its rawest format, analyze the shape and distribution of important features to better understand the data, model and ultimately make predictions for the trinary target class (Diabetes diagnosis Y, N, P), and perform gridsearches to determine optimal hyperparameters to then draw conclusions about the data's features on the target class. More specifically, due to the large target class imbalance and small dataset I used ensemble classifier methods like random forest, and gradient boosting individually as well as in tandem with SMOTE to try and optimize model performance and accuracy despite the data's caveats. This was probably my favorite and most in-depth project to date.
  - **[JavaFX Duck Hunt](https://github.com/harrison-hal3sworth/harrison-hal3sworth/tree/main/duck_hunt)**: For this project my team and I simulated a devlopment cycle using SCRUM and created an application resembling the classic arcade game "Duck Hunt". We followed object oriented design principles as best we could, generating UML diagrams along the way, refactoring messy code, and more, resulting in an assortment of Java classes with different polymorphic and inheritance relationships, and a functioning Duck Hunt game application. We sourced fonts and sprites for the graphics from the internet but the other elements were homemade, the functionality of course.
  - **[CLI Wordle Game](https://github.com/harrison-hal3sworth/harrison-hal3sworth/tree/main/wordle)**: This project is pretty self explanatory, my groupmate and I recreated the viral game "Wordle" and made it playable through the command prompt. We first read in numerous different pieces of text and used Regex to extract all words of length 5 and store them to be cycled through as the word to guess for each game. The application could be in a few different states and transitions depend on the status of the game, which takes place in the command line where guesses are entered and guess results are returned. The pressing challenge was giving feedback on guesses that indicate whether the letter is in the correct spot, in the word but not the correct spot, or simply not in the word, which we dealt with algorithmically. Simple at the surface, this project was sneakily challenging and was very fun overall.
- **IBM Client Engineering Team Intern**: Over the summer of 2024, I worked with IBM's client engineering sector, which itself is a subdivision of technical sales, and I interned as a technology engineer. As a client facing dev manufacturing Proof of Concept (PoC) projects, the development cycles were rapid, sporadic and at some points stressful, but nonetheless I enjoyed contributing to a company's belief that IBM can provide value with our products, WatsonX specifically for my team and I. For the tech engineers on the team and I, a lot of the work that came our way had to deal with frontend programming for UI's, displaying some functionality backed by WatsonX, typically some sort of chatbot or AI assistant. Prior to working to create UI's with WatsonX integrated in the backend though, we as a team were tasked with collaborating with clients to figure out first where and how we can be useful to them, what successes but also what painpoints they experience in this area, internally externally; our main goal is to empathize with the client so we can show concrete proof of a potential solution, tailor-made for them. Aside from programming, attending workshops with clients was also a key experience for me.

## Aspirations
I have a couple of career paths in mind that all equally excite me in terms of pursuing them in the future.

1.) The first path I'm considering is one as a quant analyst for a finance or tech company. There I would leverage my skills with quantitative analysis, my applied mathematics background, and my computer science and machine learning knowledge to successfully model and forecast metrics for financial assets. 

2.) The second is the typical software engineering role, preferably for consumer tech, but I also wouldn't mind something similar to the role I had with IBM or even developing for a bank or fintech company. I also would be open to a more data science/analytics role, as the classes I have taken on data mining and machine learning have been very intriguing to me, not to mention data is and I believe will remain at the forefront of technology and information for the foreseeable future.

3.) The third career path involves going to grad school and completing a podtgraduate degree in a field related to computer science, applied math, economics, or physics, and completing research either with a university or for a company like IBM. There are a wide range of topics that I would really interest me that I would consider including quantum, macroeconomic theory, semiconductors, market trends, etc. I believe my diverse background in academic topics could excel me forward if I chose to pursue this.

In whatever avenue I end up, I strongly desire to be involved with cutting edge product or research development, putting outward pressure on the current ceiling placed on whatever field or subject, that is something that drives me the most.
