# Welcome to Harrison's GitHub Profile! :)

## About Me
I am a rising senior at Bucknell Universityâ€™s College of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and minoring in Mathematics and Economics. Some relevant courses that I have taken (or will be taking in my final year) are:

- Computer Science : Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering and Design, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Operating Systems Design, Intro to Data Mining, Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, Computer Architecture and Organization, Digital System Design

- Mathematics : Calculus 1 and 2, Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis

- Economics : Econometrics, Financial Economics, Risk Management in Financial Markets

## Experience
- **IBM Client Engineering Team Intern**: Technology Engineer intern, gaining hands-on experience in various technologies and client projects.
- **Projects**:
  - **[Diabetes Data Project](https://github.com/harrison-hal3sworth/harrison-hal3sworth/tree/main/data_mining_final_proj)**: For this project I went through the entire data mining pipeline to analyze patient data related to Diabetes diagnoses. I used the numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, tensorflow libraries as well as a few others to prepare and clean the data from its rawest format, analyze the shape and distribution of important features to better understand the data, model and ultimately make predictions for the trinary target class (Diabetes diagnosis Y, N, P), and perform gridsearches to determine optimal hyperparameters to then draw conclusions about the data's features on the target class. More specifically, due to the large target class imbalance and small dataset I used ensemble classifier methods like random forest, and gradient boosting individually as well as in tandem with SMOTE to try and optimize model performance and accuracy despite the data's caveats. This was probably my favorite and most in-depth project to date.
  - **[JavaFX Duck Hunt](https://github.com/harrison-hal3sworth/harrison-hal3sworth/tree/main/duck_hunt)**: For this project my team and I simulated a devlopment cycle using SCRUM and created an application resembling the classic arcade game "Duck Hunt". We followed object oriented design principles as best we could, generating UML diagrams along the way, refactoring messy code, and more, resulting in an assortment of Java classes with different polymorphic and inheritance relationships, and a functioning Duck Hunt game application. We sourced fonts and sprites for the graphics from the internet but the other elements were homemade, the functionality of course.
  - **[CLI Wordle Game](https://github.com/harrison-hal3sworth/harrison-hal3sworth/tree/main/wordle)**: This project is pretty self explanatory, my groupmate and I recreated the viral game "Wordle" and made it playable through the command prompt. We first read in numerous different pieces of text and used Regex to extract all words of length 5 and store them to be cycled through as the word to guess for each game. The application could be in a few different states and transitions depend on the status of the game, which takes place in the command line where guesses are entered and guess results are returned. The pressing challenge was giving feedback on guesses that indicate whether the letter is in the correct spot, in the word but not the correct spot, or simply not in the word, which we dealt with algorithmically. Simple at the surface, this project was sneakily challenging and was very fun overall.

## Interests
- **Economics and Finance**: Exploring quantitative analysis, financial modeling, and investment banking.
- **Applied Math**: Enthusiastic about using mathematical principles to solve real-world problems.
- **Software Engineering**: Passionate about designing and developing software solutions.
- **Quantum Mechanics and Computing**: Fascinated by the potential of quantum technologies and their applications.
- **Hardware Engineering**: Interested in the integration of software and hardware systems.

## Aspirations
I aim to land an entry-level quant job where I can apply my skills in financial modeling, quantitative analysis, and trading. I am also open to opportunities in software or hardware engineering roles that allow me to leverage my diverse skill set.
